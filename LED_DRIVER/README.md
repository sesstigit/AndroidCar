# LED DRIVER
The LED driver board, is based on an ATTiny85 microcontroller and is used in order to drive the LEDs that can be found on the vehicle and particularly the direction indicators. In the [/res](res) folder, you can find the board's schema, how it looks like and also the Eagle files if you want to modify it or fabricate it yourself. Moreover, if you want just to reproduce the board, you can order it from [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Hk4up6hJ).
